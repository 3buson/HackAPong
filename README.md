# HackAPong

HackAPong is a pong game made for 2 players to play with myo armbands. Armbands connect to a mobile device via bluetooth.

The game contains a login screen so scores can be posted to a backend service with a leaderboard. The second screen takes care of connecting the myo armbands view bluetooth. When to armbands are successfully connected the game starts.

User has to position the armband on the hand in such way that the main node is poiting outwards when the hand is positioned with the thumb up.

Player can control the paddle with leaning the hand to the left or to the right.

Each player has five lives. Each time the ball goes of the screen a player loses a life, it's pretty straight forward :) The ball gets faster the longer the game lasts.
